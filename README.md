Develop a script that performs routine system health checks (disk space, CPU usage, memory usage).
Generate reports or notifications for any anomalies or potential issues.

This project is a system monitoring app that runs in the backround and checks for high disk, CPU, and memory usage. If high usage is detected then the IT admin will be emailed for the issue to be fixed. This can be tweaked and designed to check for anything from the status of a download to the health of a WIFI network.
